## Things for improvement in production

-   **Form Validation:**
    
    -   Implement validation rules for each field using React Hook Form's `resolver` or built-in validation methods.
    -   Provide user feedback on validation errors, including highlighting invalid fields and displaying error messages.
-   **Accessibility Improvements:**
    
    -   Ensure all form elements are accessible by adding proper aria-labels and roles.
    -   Check that the form is navigable using keyboard alone and works with screen readers.
-   **Styling and Responsiveness:**
    
    -   Fine-tune the styling to ensure consistency with the rest of the application.
    -   Verify the form’s responsiveness on various screen sizes and devices.
-   **Error Handling:**
    
    -   Add error handling for form submission, such as displaying a message when the server response indicates failure.
    -   Handle network errors gracefully.
-   **Unit and Integration Testing:**
    
    -   Write unit tests for the `CampaignForm` component using testing libraries such as Jest and React Testing Library.
    -   Conduct integration testing to ensure the form interacts correctly with APIs and other components.
-   **Performance Optimization:**
    
    -   Analyze performance impacts, particularly with large forms or complex data structures.
    -   Optimize rendering and state management if necessary.
-   **Documentation:**
    
    -   Update the component's documentation to include detailed descriptions of props, methods, and usage examples.
    -   Document the form’s validation logic and any special handling.
-   **Security Review:**
    
    -   Ensure that the form handles sensitive data securely, particularly if it deals with personal or financial information.
    - Ensure the request is authenticated and authorized using tokens(JWT/bearer, OAuth2).
    -   Verify that user input is properly sanitized and validated to prevent security vulnerabilities.
